## Challenges Faced

During the development and deployment of this project, several challenges were encountered:

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration  
Setting up the GitHub Actions workflow correctly required proper configuration of YAML files and branch triggers.

### 2. Deployment Configuration  
Ensuring the project deployed automatically to the production environment without errors required debugging path and build issues.

### 3. Branch Management  
Maintaining proper branch synchronization and avoiding merge conflicts between `develop` and `main` branches required careful coordination.
